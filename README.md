# MTH374 Linear Optimisation

This course contains all the assignments of the Linear Optimisation course taken by [Prof. Pravesh Biyani](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~praveshb/index.php) at IIIT Delhi during Winter 2019.

We did AMPL modelling in Assignment 1, followed by a Dual Phase Simplex in Assignment 3 and lastly the Primal-Dual Interior point method in Assignment 4. Assignment 2 was a theoretical assignment and is hence not shared here.


## Course Description


This course aims at introducing students to the application of optimization 
techniques to various areas of CSE and ECE. We will primarily focus on linear
optimization (linear programming) and learn about the structural and algorithmic
aspects of optimization problems. The theoretical assignments will aim at
developing the necessary skills for analysing algorithms and formulation of LPs.
Computational assignments will complement the theory by modeling real-world
problems as linear programs and solve them using publicly available solvers.
Towards the end of the course, we will briefly discuss convex programs and
semi-definite programs (SDPs) with real-world applications and point to some of
the existing solvers for this class of problems.
